Note block to command block operation for minecraft java edition 1.13+,
you can convert all the note blocks to command blocks with the execute
command (and a custom tag if you want) or with the playsound command.
Every sound can be replaced with a custom sound and the volume of every
instrument can be changed. I also added a simple operation that allows
to change rendstone ticks in repeaters in mass, without considering the
rotation, you can add 1 or remove one and there is an option to keep the
proportions between the comparators.
